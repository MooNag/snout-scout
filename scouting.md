# Commandments
1. **Scout as little as possible**. Human input means errors in data collection.
    - DO automated collection where possible. (The Blue Alliance)
    - AVOID collecting duplicate information you can find elsewhere.
        - > **EXAMPLE** collecting fumble events in match data and 
2. **Collect only relevant information**
    - DO collect information relevant to your team's strategy for the year.
        > **NOTE** A partner climb may need the collection of weight for balancing, width for sizing, and or compatibility with a specific mechanism.
3. **Collect quality data**
    - DO collect objective data.
        > **EXAMPLES** balls scored, scoring location, successful intake, 
    - AVOID subjective data like 'driving skill'
        > **NOTE** 
    - AVOID timing data.
        > **NOTE** a scout might have a hard time determining when a robot starts climbing and stops climbing.

4. **Capabilies versus successes**
    - DO collect **CAPABILITIES** in pit scouting.
        > **EXAMPLE** intake locations, climbing time
    - DO collect **SUCCESSES** in match scouting. 
        > **EXAMPLE** scoring quantity, scoring locations, did sucessfully climb, climbing level


4. **Create a document that defines each datapoint**




# Best Practices

## Human Match Scouting
- Collect events like intake, scoring, and maybe even scoring locations if relevant.
    - AVOID collecting more than 8 different events. The more data that you collect the more data entry errors there will be.

Example: 2023
- Cubes and cones. We could collect a separate event for ["Cone High", "Cone Medium", "Cone Low", "Cube High", "Cube Medium", "Cube Low"] OR we could collect ["Scored Cone", "Scored Cube", "Scored High", "Scored Middle", "Scored Low"]
- TODO Create events based on other events (for instance "cones scored" = "cone high" + "cone medium" + "cone low")

- CONSIDER NOT collecting the type of game piece that has been intaked

- Post match survey: climbing level, did play defense, apparent driving skill, note any issues or downtime, have an extra comments box, note fouls

## Human PIT scouting
- DO collect pictures
- DO keep it short
- DO collect preferences
- DO collect CAPABILITIES like automation, climbing time (verify with match data).
- DO collect compatibility information.
- AVOID collecting information that can be obtained via match scouting like Balls scored, climbing level

## Data
- AVOID collecting "cycle time" since it is directly porportional to scoring.
