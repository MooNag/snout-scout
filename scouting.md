# Best Practices
1. **Scout as little as possible**. Human input means errors in data collection.
    - DO automated collection where possible. (The Blue Alliance, statbotics)
    - AVOID collecting duplicate information you can find elsewhere.
        - > **EXAMPLE** collecting 'cycle time' since it is directly porportional to scoring, and can be calculated.
2. **Collect only relevant information**
    - DO collect information relevant to your team's strategy for the year.
        > **NOTE** A partner climb may need the collection of weight for balancing, width for sizing, and or compatibility with a specific mechanism.
3. **Collect quality data**
    - DO collect objective data.
        > **EXAMPLES** balls scored, scoring location, successful intake, 
    - CONSIDER AVOIDING subjective data like 'driving skill' since each scout will 'see' it differently.
        > **NOTE** a metric like driving skill could be useful to determine a teams 'pickability'.
    - AVOID timing data.
        > **NOTE** a scout might have a hard time determining when a robot starts climbing and stops climbing. This could instead be part of pit scouting since a climb is generally consistent in timing, and not consistent in success.
4. **Capabilies versus successes**
    - DO collect **CAPABILITIES** in pit scouting.
        > **EXAMPLE** intake locations, climbing time, compatibility with a specific mechanism.
    - DO collect **SUCCESSES** in match scouting. 
        > **EXAMPLE** scoring quantity, scoring locations, did sucessfully climb, climbing level
5. **Order is easier than disorder**
    - DO collect scouting information in order.
        > **EXAMPLE** A match recording survey should ask for things in auto before endgame.
        > **EXAMPLE** Pit scouting questions should have a natural order that encurages a good conversation flow.
6. **Create a document that defines each datapoint**
    - TODO snout scout should allow for documentation inside of the event config.





# Human Match Scouting
- Collect events like intake, scoring, and maybe even scoring locations if relevant.
    - AVOID collecting more than 8 different events. The more data that you collect the more data entry errors there will be.

Example: 2023
- Cubes and cones. We could collect a separate event for ["Scored Cone", "Scored Cube", "Scored High", "Scored Middle", "Scored Low", "Inake", "Fumble"]
- CONSIDER NOT collecting the type of game piece that has been intaked
- Post match survey: climbing level, did play defense, apparent driving skill, note any issues or downtime, have an extra comments box, note fouls

# Human PIT scouting
- DO collect pictures
- DO keep it short
- DO make it personal (ask for robot name, or questions to encourage conversation)
- DO collect preferences
- DO collect CAPABILITIES like automation, climbing time (verify with match data).
- DO collect compatibility information.
- DO NOT collect information that can be obtained via match scouting like Balls scored, climbing level

# Data

## Naming conventions
- Keep names short and unambiguous
